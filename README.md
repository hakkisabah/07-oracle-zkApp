This repo have 3 folder contract, oracle and zkApp-Vue-Frontend.

If you want to run this project, you have to follow this steps synchronously.

- First of all we need oracle server. You can find instructions in oracle folder.([here](https://github.com/hakkisabah/07-oracle-zkApp/tree/main/oracle))
- In contracts folder deploy to network with zk CLI. And if you not use remote oracle you will use your localhost(Oracle server included)([here](https://github.com/hakkisabah/07-oracle-zkApp/tree/main/contracts))
- zkApp use vue(vite) and vue3. You should use yarn package manager. If you want to run this project, you have to run this commands in zkApp-Vue-Frontend folder.
  - yarn install
  - yarn dev



I think I accomplished something by doing a lot of research. I would like to write this message in more detail, but now there is less than 1 hour until the end of the competition and I had to write a lesser explanation than I thought due to wasted efforts.
